    Object that sometimes shouldn't really be duplicated.

    Say some plain object references a `CrossProcessPersistent` object. Then
    that plain object gets deepcopied with the `DontCopyPersistent` copy mode.
    The plain object will get deepcopied, but the `CrossProcessPersistent`
    object under it will not! The new copy of the plain object will refer to
    the same old copy of the `CrossProcessPersistent` object.
    
    This is useful for objects which are read-only and possibly heavy. You may
    use `CrossProcessPersistent` as a base class for these kinds of objects.
    
    Keep in mind that a `CrossProcessPersistent` is read-only. This means that
    starting from the first time that it is copied or put in a queue, it should
    not be changed.

    There is no mechanism that enforces that the user doesn't change the
    object, so the user must remember not to change it.
    
    What this class adds over `Persistent`, is that when a
    `CrossProcessPersistent` is passed around between processes in queues, each
    process retains only one copy of it.
    
    Note: This class is still experimental.
