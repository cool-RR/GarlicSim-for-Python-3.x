This module defines the `ObsoleteCruncherError` exception.

See its documentation for more info.

class ObsoleteCruncherError(BaseException):
    '''
    The cruncher that got this exception raised became obsolte.
    
    The cruncher is trying to do work, but in the meantime the main program
    decided that the work assigned to this cruncher is no longer wanted, and
    should therefore be stopped.

    # Inherits from BaseException because it is an exit exception    
    # todo: I heard that `BaseException.message` is deprecated! Problematic?
    # Maybe make `CuteBaseException`?
