    A step generator takes an initial state and keeps yielding states from it.

    A history step function takes a history browser and returns a new state.

    some types of simulations.

    A history step generator takes a history browser and yields new states.
    
    This combines the advantages of a history step function and a step
    generator; It works as a generator which can be more convenient and it can
    look at the simulation history which is necessary for some simulations.

class InplaceStep(BaseStep):
    '''
    Inplace step function takes a state and modifies it to be the next state.
    
    The advantage of the inplace step function is that it doesn't need to
    create a new state object, so it may have better performance than a simple
    step function. But if the user still wants it to create new state objects,
    (which is necessary in order to make a tree,) `garlicsim` will
    automatically `deepcopy` all the states given from the inplace step
    function. So it can be used both ways.

    Inplace step generator is a step generator that does the step in-place.
    
    On every iteration, the inplace step generator modifies the current state
    to be the next state.
    
    The inplace step generator combines the advantages an inplace step function
    and a step generator: It works as a generator which can be more convenient
    and it allows modifying the state in-place to improve performance.
