Installing GarlicSim
====================

Do you want to install GarlicSim as an **end user**, or as a **developer**?

:ref:`Installation for end-users <intro-installation-end-users-index>` -- Use this if
you just want to run GarlicSim as a desktop app, like Photoshop or Word. You
don't have to know programming to use GarlicSim this way. (Currently Windows
only.)

:ref:`Installation for developers <intro-installation-developers-index>` -- Do
this if you want to create your own simulation packages using GarlicSim. You'll
need to be familiar with `Python`_ to do that. This will install the GarlicSim
packages to your existing Python distribution.
