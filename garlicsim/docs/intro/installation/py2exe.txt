All-in-one Windows installer for GarlicSim
==========================================

If you don't have Python installed on your system, or you don't even know what
Python is, (and you use Windows,) this is for you:

`Download all-in-one Windows GarlicSim 0.6.2 installer
<http://github.com/downloads/cool-RR/GarlicSim/GarlicSim-0.6.2.exe>`_

This installer will give you :mod:`garlicsim`, :mod:`garlicsim_lib` and
:mod:`garlicsim_wx`.

A similiar all-in-one installer for Mac will become available in 2011.
