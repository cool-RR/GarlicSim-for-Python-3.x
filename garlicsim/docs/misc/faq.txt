What kind of simulations will I be able to do with GarlicSim?
-------------------------------------------------------------

People often ask this; probably because they do not fully believe it when they
read GarlicSim's description saying that it can handle any kind of simulation.
Well, it can. It is very general.

Then people ask:

If it is so general, how is it useful?
--------------------------------------

There are two answers to that:

1. It is very useful. There are many many features that are common to all kinds
   of simulations, and which you really don't want to spend time writing. A few
   examples of such features: Saving the simulation to file. Browsing
   the timeline of a simulation like a movie clip while it is still crunching
   in the background. The option to make manual changes to the simulation
   world, observe their effects on how the simulation unfolds, and then to 
   be able to revert to the timeline in which the changes were not applied.
   Changing the arguments to the step function on the fly, etc.
   
2. If you are interested in only a specific subset of simulations -- say,
   simulations of solid bodies in Physics -- Then it will be the wisest to
   write a framework for that within the framework of GarlicSim. Indeed, part
   of the work on GarlicSim will include writing these kind of sub-frameworks
   for the common categories of simulations (e.g., a framework for physics, a
   framework for game theory, etcetera.)

Does GarlicSim give mathematical tools for simulations?
-------------------------------------------------------

**No.**

GarlicSim doesn't contain any mathematical tools, or any algorithms to be used
in simulations. These things are related to the **content** of the simulation,
which is none of GarlicSim's business.
                    
GarlicSim handles the organization, or "bureaucracy" of the simulation, so you
can concentrate on the content. If you need mathematical tools for your
simulation `there <http://scipy.org>`_ `are <http://code.enthought.com>`_ `many
<http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/>`_ Python
projects that provide them, and you may use them in your simpack that you run
with GarlicSim.
