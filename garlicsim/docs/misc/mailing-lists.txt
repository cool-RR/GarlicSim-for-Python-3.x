Mailing Lists
=============

The main GarlicSim mailing list is at `garlicsim@librelist.org
<mailto:garlicsim@librelist.org>`_. If you need any kind of help, or have
anything to say, say it here. You'll get a quick response.

The development mailing list is `garlicsim.dev@librelist.org
<mailto:garlicsim.dev@librelist.org>`_. This is for the developers who work on
GarlicSim itself.

To subscribe to a list, just send an empty email to it. This is required before
you can post anything. Wait for an automated email asking you to confirm, then
confirm, and only then you will be registered.

These lists are hosted by `librelist <http://librelist.org>`_, which is
currently slightly experimental.
