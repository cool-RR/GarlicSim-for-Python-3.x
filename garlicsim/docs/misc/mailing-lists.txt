There are three GarlicSim groups, a.k.a. mailing lists:

- If you need help with GarlicSim, post a message on `the GarlicSim Google Group
  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/garlicsim>`_. If you need any kind of
  help, or have anything to say, say it there. You'll get a quick response.

- If you want to help on the development of GarlicSim itself, come say hello on
  `the GarlicSim-dev Google Group
  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/garlicsim-dev>`_.

- If you want to be informed on new releases of GarlicSim, sign up for `the low-traffic
  GarlicSim-announce Google Group
  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/garlicsim-announce>`_.
