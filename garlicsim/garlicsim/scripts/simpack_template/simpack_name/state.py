        # test-drive your simulation.

    # Do you want to use a step generator as your step function? If so, you may
    # uncomment the above and fill it in, and it will be used instead of the
    # normal step function.
    # 
    # A step generator is similar to a regular step function: it takes a
    # starting state, and computes the next state. But it doesn't `return` it,
    # it `yield`s it. And then it doesn't exit, it just keeps on crunching and
    # yielding more states one by one.
    # 
    # A step generator is useful when you want to set up some environment
    # and/or variables when you do your crunching. It can help you save
    # resources, because you won't have to do all that initialization every
    # time garlicsim computes a step.
    #
    # (You may write your step generator to terminate at some point or to never
    # terminate-- Both ways are handled by `garlicsim`.)
