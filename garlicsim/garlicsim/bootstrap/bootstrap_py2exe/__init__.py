'''
Package for bootstrapping `garlicsim` when frozen by py2exe.

This runs a bundled version of Python's `site` module, which adds things like
`help` to `__builtins__`. This is useful because py2exe has problems with
packaging the standard `site` module.

The `python26_site` module in this package is simply the `site` module from
Python 2.6's standard library; if you want to package `garlicsim` with py2exe
for a different version of Python, this package will need to be expanded with
that version's `site` module.
