class StepCopy(DontCopyPersistent, CopyMode):
    '''
    A copy mode used in a step function to generate the next state.
    
    A popular design pattern in step functions is to `deepcopy` the old state,
    modify it, and then return it as the new state. When this is done, you
    should pass `StepCopy()` into the `deepcopy` function as a memo. This
    assures that certain objects get copied in the right way for this context.
