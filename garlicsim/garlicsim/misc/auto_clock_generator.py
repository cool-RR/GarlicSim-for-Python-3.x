    Device for ensuring that states have good clock readings.
    
    This is useful so the user could be lazy and not write code that advances
    the clock reading of a state.
    
    If we get a state with no clock reading, we give it a clock reading of one
    plus the last state's clock reading.
    
    If `detect_static` is set to `True`, we give the same treatment to states
    that have a clock reading which is identical to the last state's.
