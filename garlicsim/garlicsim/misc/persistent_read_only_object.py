Note: This module is still experimental.

todo: need to lock library to avoid thread trouble?

todo: need to raise an exception if we're getting pickled with
an old protocol?

todo: make it polite to other similar classes

todo: what happens when you want to fork-by-editing a state and change
a big 3-d model which is a PRO?

    A class to use as a subclass for objects which do not change.
    When copying a PersistentReadOnlyObject, it is not really copied; The new
    "copy" is just the same object.
    When a PersistentReadOnlyObject is passed around between processes in
    queues, each process retains only one copy of it.
    
    What does it mean that the object is read-only? It means that starting from
    the first time that it is copied or put in a queue, it should not be
    changed.

    There is no mechanism that enforces that the user doesn't change the
    object.
    
    Note: This class is still experimental.
