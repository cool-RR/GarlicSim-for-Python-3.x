    An `End` signifies that the simulation has ended. This is relevant in only
    some simpacks; Some simpacks have a concept of ending the simulation, and
    some don't. When a simulation was crunched and reached its end on some
    timeline, the last node on that timeline will have an `End` object added to
    its `.ends` list.
