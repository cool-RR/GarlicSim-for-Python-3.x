    Return whether all elements in the iterable are equal to each other.
    
    If `exhaustive` is set to `False`, it's assumed that the equality relation
    is transitive, therefore not every member is tested against every other
    member. So in a list of size `n`, `n-1` equality checks will be made.
    
    If `exhaustive` is set to `True`, every member will be checked against
    every other member. So in a list of size `n`, `(n*(n-1))/2` equality checks
    will be made.
