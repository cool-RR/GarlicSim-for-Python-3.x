    Cache a function, saving results so they won't have to be computed again.
    
    This decorator understands function arguments. For example, it understands
    that for a function like this:
    
        def f(a, b=2):
            return whatever
            
    The calls `f(1)` or `f(1, 2)` or `f(b=2, a=1)` are all identical, and a
    cached result saved for one of these calls will be used for the others.
    
    All the arguments are sleekreffed to prevent memory leaks. Sleekref is a
    variation of weakref. Sleekref is when you try to weakref an object, but if
    it's non-weakreffable, like a `list` or a `dict`, you maintain a normal,
    strong reference to it. (See documentation of
    `garlicsim.general_misc.sleek_refs` for more details.) Thanks to
    sleekreffing you can avoid memory leaks when using weakreffable arguments,
    but if you ever want to use non-weakreffable arguments you are still able
    to. (Assuming you don't mind the memory leaks.)
    
    You may optionally specify a `max_size` for maximum number of cached
    results to store; Old entries are thrown away according to a
    least-recently-used alogrithm. (Often abbreivated LRU.)

    # todo idea: figure how how complex the function's argspec is, and then
    # compile a function accordingly, so functions with a simple argspec won't
    # have to go through so much shit. update: probably it will help only for
    # completely argumentless function. so do one for those.
