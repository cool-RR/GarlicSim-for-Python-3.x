'''Module for doing a binary search in a sequence.'''

# Todo: wrap all things in tuples?
# 
# todo: add option to specify `cmp`.
# 
# todo: i think `binary_search_by_index` should have the core logic, and the
# other one will use it. I think this will save many sequence accesses, and
# some sequences can be expensive.
#
# todo: ensure there are no `if variable` checks where we're thinking of None
# but the variable might be False

    Similiar to binary_search (refer to its documentation for more info). The
    difference is that instead of returning a result in terms of sequence
    items, it returns the indexes of these items in the sequence.

    Do a binary search through a sequence.
    
    It is assumed that `function` is a monotonic rising function on `sequence`.
    
    For all rounding options, a return value of None is returned if no matching
    item is found. (In the case of `rounding=BOTH`, either of the items in the
    tuple may be `None`)
    
    Note: This function uses `None` to express its inability to find any
    matches; therefore, you better not use it on sequences in which None is a
    possible item.
    
    For documentation of rounding options, check `binary_search.roundings`.
