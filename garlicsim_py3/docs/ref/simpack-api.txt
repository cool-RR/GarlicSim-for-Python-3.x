Simpack API
===========

This document explains how to write a GarlicSim simpack. In order to get
started quickly with your simpack, it is recommended that you use the
:command:`start_simpack.py` script. (Launch ``start_simpack.py --help`` for
details.) This script will create a simpack skeleton with all the required
definitions, so you could easily fill the contents in instead of creating files
manually.

Every simpack *must* define a ``State`` class, which contains the most
important part of the simpack: The step function. The ``State`` class may also
define a few other helpful bits for added functionality, like a
``create_messy_root`` method, but these are not mandatory.

The simpack may also contain a ``settings.py`` module which specifies a few
settings, all of them optional.


Mandatory definitions
=====================

The ``State`` class
-------------------

The simpack must define a ``State`` class, which must inherit from
:class:`garlicsim.data_structures.State`. The ``State`` class must be available
from the root namespace of your simpack; this is usually done by putting a
``from .state import State`` line in your simpack's ``__init__.py``.

Example ``State`` class::

    class State(garlicsim.data_structures.State):
        # Your step function(s) here...

        
Step function(s)
----------------

The step function is the most important part of your simpack, and, (not
counting the ``State`` class itself,) it's the only definition that your
simpack *must* make.

There are several different kinds of step functions, as will be detailed below.
You only have to define *one* step function, but you *may* define multiple step
functions, from multiple types. (Just don't mix history-dependent ones with
non-history-dependent ones.)

:ref:`More detailed explanations about step functions can be found here.
<topics-step-functions>`

* ``def step(self, <optional defaultful arguments>):`` -- :ref:`Simple step function
  <simple-step-function>` -- A simple step function, which takes a state and
  returns a new state that follows it in time.
  
* ``def inplace_step(self, <optional defaultful arguments>):`` -- :ref:`Inplace
  step function <inplace-step-function>` -- An inplace step function, which takes
  a state and modifies it in place to be "the next state".

* ``def step_generator(self, <optional defaultful arguments>):`` -- :ref:`Step
  generator <step-generator>` -- A step generator, taking an initial state and
  :keyword:`yield`\s new states indefinitely.

* ``def inplace_step_generator(self, <optional defaultful arguments>):`` --
  :ref:`Inplace step generator <inplace-step-generator>` -- An inplace step
  generator, taking an initial state and, on every iteration, modifies it in
  place to be "the next state".

* ``def history_step(history_browser, <optional defaultful arguments>):`` --
  :ref:`History step function <history-step-function>` -- A history step function
  takes an history browser instead of a state. The history browser allows it to
  inspect the entire history of the simulation. Returns the next state. Is
  usually a ``staticmethod``.

* (Not yet implemented, sorry:) ``def history_step_generator(history_browser,
  <optional defaultful arguments>):`` -- :ref:`History step generator
  <history-step-generator>` -- A history step generator takes an history browser
  instead of a state. The history browser allows it to inspect the entire history
  of the simulation. Keeps :keyword:`yield`\ing new states indefinitely. Is
  usually a ``staticmethod``.
  

Non-mandatory definitions
=========================

State creation methods
----------------------

You may define methods for creating new states objects. These should be made
inside the ``State`` class as ``staticmethod``\s.

* ``def create_root(<optional defaultful arguments>):`` - Create a plain state,
  i.e. a state which is empty and featureless, like an empty canvas.

* ``def create_messy_root(<optional defaultful arguments>):`` - Create a messy 
  state, i.e. a state which is random and has interesting features. This is 
  mainly intended for playing around with the simulation, which is very 
  important.
  

``settings.py`` module
----------------------

You may define a bunch of definitions, listed below, as globals in a
``settings.py`` module. (You may also have a ``settings`` *package* instead, or
any other kind of ``settings`` object that holds settings as attributes.)

Again, all of these settings are optional. You don't even have to have a
``settings.py`` module if you don't need it.


CRUNCHERS
^^^^^^^^^

Cruncher types that this simpack says it can use.

Cruncher types can be specified in different ways. You may specify either (a) a
cruncher type, or (b) the string name of a cruncher type, or (c) a list of
either of those (sorted by priority,) or (d) a filter function for cruncher
types.

This is useful because some simpacks can't be used with certain kinds of
crunchers.

A few examples::

    CRUNCHERS = garlicsim.asynchronous_crunching.crunchers.ThreadCruncher

Or::

    CRUNCHERS = 'ProcessCruncher'
    
Or::

    CRUNCHERS = ['ThreadCruncher', 'ProcessCruncher']
    
Or::

    def CRUNCHERS(cruncher_type):
        return True
    

DETERMINISM_FUNCTION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Function that takes a step profile and says whether its deterministic.

What this function says is, "If you do a simulation using this step profile,
then you will have a deterministic simulation." (Or undeterministic, depends on
the step profile.)

This is useful because it allows GarlicSim to detect if a simulation has
reached a repititive state, so it can stop the crunching right there and
avoid wasting resources. (Still not implemented, sorry.)

Note that this function does not return :data:`True` or :data:`False`: It
returns a ``DeterminismSetting`` class, from the
:mod:`garlicsim.misc.settings_constants.settings` module.

The function will return :data:`None` if it's unknown whether the step profile is
deterministic.

Example::

    def DETERMINISM_FUNCTION(step_profile):
        if step_profile.step_function == State.step:
            if step_profile.randomness == 0:
                return garlicsim.misc.settings_constants.DETERMINISTIC
            else:
                return garlicsim.misc.settings_constants.UNDETERMINISTIC
        else:
            return None
