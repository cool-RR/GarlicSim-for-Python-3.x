    Cruncher that crunches from a process.
    
    A cruncher is a worker which crunches the simulation. It receives a state
    from the main program, and then it repeatedly applies the step function of
    the simulation to produce more states. Those states are then put in the
    cruncher's `.work_queue`. They are then taken by the main program when
    `Project.sync_crunchers` is called, and put into the tree.
        
    Read more about crunchers in the documentation of the `crunchers` package.
    
    The advantage of `ProcessCruncher` over `ThreadCruncher` is that
    `ProcessCruncher` is able to run on a different core of the processor in the
    machine, thus using the full power of the processor.
