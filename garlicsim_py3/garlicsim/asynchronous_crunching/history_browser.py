    A device for requesting information about the history of the simulation.
    
    A `HistoryBrowser` is a device for requesting information about the history
    of the simulation. It is intended to be used by `ThreadCruncher` in
    simulations that are history-dependent.
    
    With a `HistoryBrowser` one can request states from the simulation's
    timeline. States can be requested by clock time or position in the timeline
    or by other measures; see documentation for this class's methods.
    
    Since we do not know whether the states we request have been implemented in
    the tree already, or they are still in the `.work_queue`, it's the job of
    the `HistoryBrowser` to find that out. This is done transperantly for the
    user.
    
    When using a `HistoryBroswer`, the lock of the project's tree is acquired
    for reading. That acquiring action can also be invoked by using
    `HistoryBrowser` as a context manager.
