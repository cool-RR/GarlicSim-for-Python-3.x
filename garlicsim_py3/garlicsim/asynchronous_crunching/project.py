    A simulation project. This is the flagship class of `garlicsim`.
    
    You create a project when you want to do a simulation which will crunch
    in the background with worker threads or worker processes.

    A project contains within it a tree.
        
    The crunching is taken care of by the `CrunchingManager` which is a part of
    every project. The `CrunchingManager` employs crunchers (which may be, for
    example, worker threads or worker processes,) to get the work done. To make
    the crunching manager take work from the crunchers and coordinate them, 
    call the `.sync_crunchers` method of the project.
    
    The crunching manager contains a list of jobs as an attribute `.jobs`. See
    documentation for `garlicsim.asynchronous_crunching.Job` for more info 
    about jobs. The crunching manager will employ crunchers in order to 
    complete the jobs. It will then take work from these crunchers, put it 
    into the tree, and delete the jobs when they are completed.
