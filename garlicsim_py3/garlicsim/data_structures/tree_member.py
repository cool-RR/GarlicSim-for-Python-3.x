        '''
        Get the length of the tree member.
        
        For a node or an end, this will be 1. For a block, it will be the
        number of contained nodes.

        Get the block that this tree member is on, or itself if it's a block.
        
        If it's not a part of a block, return itself.

        Create a path that contains this tree member.
        
        There may be multiple different paths that contain this tree member.
        This will return the one which points to the newest possible forks.

        Note: There may be paths that contain this tree member which will not
        be identical to one of the paths given here, because these other paths
        may specify decisions that are not even on the same root as these
        paths.

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get_all_leaves(self, max_nodes_distance=None, max_clock_distance=None):
        '''
        Get all leaves that are descendents of this tree member.
        
        Only leaves with a distance of at most `max_nodes_distance` in nodes or
        `max_clock_distance` in clock are returned. (Note this is an OR
        relation between the two condintions)

        Get an ancestor of this tree member.
        
        `generations` specifies the number of generation that the returned
        ancestor should be above the current tree member. `round` determines
        how this method will behave if it was asked for too many generations
        back, and not enough existed. If `round` is `True`, it will return the
        root. If `round` is `False`, it will raise a `NodeLookupError`.

        of... the parent of this tree member.
