Script for starting a new simpack.

This is a script for creating a skeleton for a `garlicsim` simpack. Use this
when you want to make a new simpack to have the basic folders and files created
for you.

Usage:

    start_simpack.py my_simpack_name

The simpack will be created in the current path, in a directory with the name
of the simpack.
