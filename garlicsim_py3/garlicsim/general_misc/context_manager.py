Defines the `ContextManager` and `ContextManagerType` classes.

These classes allow for greater freedom both when (a) defining context managers
and when (b) using them.

Inherit all your context managers from `ContextManager` (or decorate your
generator functions with `ContextManagerType`) to enjoy all the benefits
described below.


Defining context managers
-------------------------

There are 3 different ways in which context managers can be defined, and each
has their own advantages and disadvantages over the others.

 1. The classic way to define a context manager is to define a class with 
    `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. This is allowed, and if you do this
    you should still inherit from `ContextManager`. Example:
     
        class MyContextManager(ContextManager):
            def __enter__(self):
                pass # preparation
            def __exit__(self, type_=None, value=None, traceback=None):
                pass # cleanup
     
 2. As a decorated generator, like so:
    
        @ContextManagerType
        def MyContextManager():
            try:
                yield
            finally:
                pass # clean-up
                
    This usage is nothing new; It's also available when using the standard
    library's `contextlib.contextmanager` decorator. One thing that is allowed
    here that `contextlib` doesn't allow is to yield the context manager itself
    by doing `yield SelfHook`.
    
 3. The third and novel way is by defining a class with a `manage_context`
    method which returns a decorator. Example:
    
        class MyContextManager(ContextManager):
            def manage_context(self):
                do_some_prepartion()
                try:
                    with some_lock:
                        yield self
                finally:
                    do_some_cleanup()
                    
    This approach is sometimes cleaner than defining `__enter__` and
    `__exit__`; Especially when using another context manager inside
    `manage_context`. In our example we did `with some_lock` in our
    `manage_context`, which is shorter and more idiomatic than calling
    `some_lock.__enter__` in an `__enter__` method and `some_lock.__exit__` in
    an `__exit__` method.
    
    
These were the different ways of *defining* a context manager. Now let's see
the different ways of *using* a context manager:


Using context managers
----------------------

There are 2 different ways in which context managers can be used:

 1. The plain old honest-to-Guido `with` keyword:
 
       with MyContextManager() as my_context_manager:
           do_stuff()
           
 2. As a decorator to a function
 
        @MyContextManager()
        def do_stuff():
           pass # doing stuff
           
    When the `do_stuff` function will be called, the context manager will be
    used. This functionality is also available in the standard library of
    Python 3.2+ by using `contextlib.ContextDecorator`, but here it is combined
    with all the other goodies given by `ContextManager`.

    
That's it. Inherit all your context managers from `ContextManager` (or decorate
your generator functions with `ContextManagerType`) to enjoy all these
benefits.

class SelfHook(object):
    '''
    Hook that a context manager can yield in order to yield itself.

    This is useful in context managers which are created from a generator,
    where the user can't do `yield self` because `self` doesn't exist yet.
    
    Example:
    
        @ContextGeneratorType
        def MyContextManager(lock):
            with lock.read:
                yield SelfHook
                
        with MyContextManager(my_lock) as my_context_manager:
            assert isinstance(my_context_manager, MyContextManager)
    
    '''
    # todo: make uninstantiable


class ContextManagerTypeType(type):
    '''Metaclass for `ContextManagerType`. Shouldn't be used directly.'''
    
    def __call__(cls, *args):
        '''
        Create a new `ContextManager`.
        
        This can work in two ways, depending on which arguments are given:
        
         1. The classic `type.__call__` way. If `name, bases, namespace` are
            passed in, `type.__call__` will be used normally.
            
         2. As a decorator for a generator function. For example:
            
                @ContextManagerType
                def MyContextManager():
                    try:
                        yield
                    finally:
                        pass # clean-up
                        
            What happens here is that the function (in this case
            `MyContextManager`) is passed directly into
            `ContextManagerTypeType.__call__`. So we create a new
            `ContextManager` subclass for it, and use the original generator as
            its `.manage_context` function.

    Use this directly as a decorator to create a `ContextManager` from a
