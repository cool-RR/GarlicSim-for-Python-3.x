    A ReadWriteLock subclassed from a different ReadWriteLock class defined

    This subclass adds two context managers, one for reading and one for
    writing.
    
    Usage:
    
    lock = ReadWriteLock()
    with lock.read:
        pass #perform read operations here
    with lock.write:
        pass #perform write operations here
