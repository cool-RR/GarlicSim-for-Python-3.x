class Project(object):
    '''
    A simulation project. This is the flagship class of `garlicsim`.
    
    You create a project when you want to do a simulation which will crunch
    in the background with worker threads or worker processes.

    A project contains within it a tree.
        
    The crunching is taken care of by the CrunchingManager which is a part of
    every project. The CrunchingManager employs CruncherThreads and/or
    CruncherProcesses to get the work done. To make the CrunchingManager take
    work from the crunchers and coordinate them, call the sync_crunchers method
    of the project.
    
    The crunching manager contains a list of jobs as an attribute `.jobs`. See
    documentation for garlicsim.asynchronous_crunching.Job for more info about
    jobs. The crunching manager will employ crunchers in order to complete the
    jobs. It will then take work from these crunchers, put it into the tree,
    and delete the jobs when they are completed.
