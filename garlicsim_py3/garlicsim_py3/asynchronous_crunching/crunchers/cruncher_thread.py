    '''
    CruncherThread is a type of cruncher.
    
    A cruncher is a worker which crunches the simulation. It receives a state
    from the main program, and then it repeatedly applies the step function of
    the simulation to produce more states. Those states are then put in the
    cruncher's work_queue. They are then taken by the main program when
    Project.sync_crunchers is called, and put into the tree.
        
    Read more about crunchers in the documentation of the crunchers package.
    
    The advantages of CruncherThread over CruncherProcess are:
    1. CruncherThread is able to handle simulations that are history-dependent,
       which would have been very hard to implement in a Process, since
       processes don't share memory, and threads do share memory trivially.
    2. CruncherThread is based on the threading module, which is stabler and
       more mature than the multiprocessing module.
    3. CruncherThread is much easier to debug than CruncherProcess, since there
       are currently many more tools for debugging Python threads than Python
       processes.
    4. On a single-core computer, CruncherThread may be faster than
       CruncherProcess because of shared memory.
