This module defines the CruncherProcess class.

See its documentation for more information.

This module requires the multiprocessing package to be installed. It is part of
the standard library for Python 2.6 and above, but not for earlier versions.
Backports of it for Python 2.4 and 2.5 are available on the internet.

    '''
    CruncherProcess is a type of cruncher.
    
    A cruncher is a worker which crunches the simulation. It receives a state
    from the main program, and then it repeatedly applies the step function of
    the simulation to produce more states. Those states are then put in the
    cruncher's work_queue. They are then taken by the main program when
    Project.sync_crunchers is called, and put into the tree.
        
    Read more about crunchers in the documentation of the crunchers package.
    
    The advantage of CruncherProcess over CruncherThread is that
    CruncherProcess is able to run on a different core of the processor
    in the machine, thus using the full power of the processor.
