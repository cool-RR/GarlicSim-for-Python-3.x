    A crunching manager manages the background crunching for a project.
    
    Every project creates a crunching manager. The job of the crunching manager
    is to coordinate the crunchers, creating and retiring them as necessary.
    The main use of a crunching manager is through its sync_workers methods,
    which goes over all the crunchers and all the nodes of the tree that need
    to be crunched, making sure the crunchers are working on these nodes, and
    collecting work from them to implement into the tree.
    
    The crunching manager contains a list of jobs as an attribute `.jobs`. See
    documentation for garlicsim.asynchronous_crunching.Job for more info about
    jobs. The crunching manager will employ crunchers in order to complete the
    jobs. It will then take work from these crunchers, put it into the tree,
    and delete the jobs when they are completed.
