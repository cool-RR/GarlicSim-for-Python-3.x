    A path represents a line of nodes in a tree.
    
    A tree may be complex and contain many junctions, but a path is a direct
    line through it. Therefore, a path object contains information about which
    child to choose when going through a node which has multiple children.
    
    Some of Path's method accept `start` and `end` parameters for specifying a
    sub-range inside the path. It should be noted that this range will include
    both endpoints.
