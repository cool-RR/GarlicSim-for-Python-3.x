    A device for bundling together a succession of natural nodes.
    
    
    Blocks make the tree more organized and easy to browse, and improve
    performance.

    When you're doing a simulation, often you'll have a succession of 1000+
    natural nodes, which were created "organically", each from its parent,
    by simulation. Having a block to group these nodes together imporves
    efficiency.

    Who qualifies to get wrapped in a block? A succession of untouched nodes,
    which:
        1. Is at least 2 nodes in number.
        2. All members, except the last one, must have no children except
           their successor in the block.
        3. The last node may have any kinds of children.
        4. All members share the same step_profile.

    If you want to check whether a certain node is in a block or not,
    check its ".block" attribute.
