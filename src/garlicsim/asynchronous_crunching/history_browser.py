    A HistoryBrowser is a device for requesting information about the history
    of the simulation. It is intended to be used by CruncherThread in
    simulations that are history-dependent.
    
    With a HistoryBrowser one can request states from the simulation's
    timeline. States can be requested by clock time or position in the timeline
    or by other measures; See documentation for this class's methods.
    
    Since we do not know whether the states we request have been implemented in
    the tree already, or they are still in the work_queue, it's the job of the
    HistoryBrowser to find that out. This is done transperantly for the user.
    
    When using a HistoryBroswer, the tree_lock of the project is acquired
    for reading. That acquiring action can also be invoked by using
    HistoryBrowser as a context manager.
    
    
    todo in the future: because historybrowser retains a reference to a node,
    when the user deletes a node we should mark it so the historybrowser will
    know it's dead.
    
    todo: make it easy to use hisotrybrowser's method from a separate thread,
    so when waiting for a lock the cruncher could still be productive.
        
    todo: maybe I've exaggerated in using @with_self in so many places?
