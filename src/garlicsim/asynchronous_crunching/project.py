    You create a project when you want to do a simulation which will crunch
    in the background with worker threads or worker processes.

    A project contains within it a tree.
        
    The crunching is taken care of by the CrunchingManager which is a part of
    every project. The CrunchingManager employs CruncherThreads and/or
    CruncherProcesses to get the work done. To make the CrunchingManager take
    work from the crunchers and coordinate them, call the sync_crunchers method
    of the project.
    
    What the crunching manager's sync_crunchers method will do is check the
    attribute .nodes_to_crunch of the project. This attribute is a dict 
    which maps nodes that should be crunched to a TODO. The crunching manager will
    then coordinate the crunchers in order to do this work. It will update the
    .nodes_to_crunch attribute when the crunchers have completed some of the
    work.
