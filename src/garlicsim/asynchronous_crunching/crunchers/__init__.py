This package defines two crunchers, CruncherThread and CruncherProcess.
They work in a similar way, but they are based on threading.Thread
and multiprocessing.Process respectively.

A cruncher is a worker which crunches the simulation. It receives a state from
the main program, and then it repeatedly applies the step function of the
simulation to produce more states. Those states are then put in the cruncher's
work_queue. They are then taken by the main program when Project.sync_crunchers
is called, and put into the tree.

The cruncher also receives a crunching profile from the main program. The
crunching profile specifes how far the cruncher should crunch the simulation,
and which arguments it should pass to the step function.

The main reason there are two kinds of crunchers is that some simulations,
albeit a small minority of them, are history-dependent: They require access
to the history of the world in order to calculate the next step. This is very
hard to implement using Process, because information transfer between processes
is complicated. This is why CruncherThread was born, as threads share memory
trivially between them.

Another reason for CruncherThread is that on single-core computer it might
be faster than CruncherProcess because of the memory-sharing.
