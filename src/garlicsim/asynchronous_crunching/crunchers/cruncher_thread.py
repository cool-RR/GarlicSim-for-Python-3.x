    CruncherThread is a type of cruncher.
    
    A cruncher is a worker which crunches the simulation. It receives a state
    from the main program, and then it repeatedly applies the step function of
    the simulation to produce more states. Those states are then put in the
    cruncher's work_queue. They are then taken by the main program when
    Project.sync_crunchers is called, and put into the tree.
        
    Read more about crunchers in the documentation of the crunchers package.
    
    The advantage of CruncherThread over CruncherProcess is that
    CruncherThread is able to handle simulations that are history-dependent.
