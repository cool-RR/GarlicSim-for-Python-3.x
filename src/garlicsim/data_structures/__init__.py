"""
The data_structures package defines data structures that are used for saving
simulation data in memory. It defines the State, Node, Tree, Block, and Path
classes.
States are used to save a single world state of the simulation. Nodes are used
to put states in chronological order inside a Tree. Paths are used to indicate
specific timelines inside a tree. Blocks, which are not as critical as the
other types of objects, are used to optimize access to long successions of
nodes.
