    A state describes a world state in the simulation; it contains information
    about a "frozen moment" in the simulation.

    All the information about the state of the simulation should be saved in
    attributes of the state object.

    When a state is created, a ".clock" attribute must be assigned to it,
    specifying what time it is in this state.

    A state object must always be picklable, as do all the attributes assigned
    to it.
