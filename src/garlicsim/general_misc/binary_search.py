    Does a binary search through a sequence.
    
    It is assumed that `function` is a montonic rising function on `sequence`.

    There are five options for the "rounding" parameter:
    "high": Gives the lowest sequence item which has value greater than `value`
    "low": Gives the highest sequence item which has value smaller than `value`
    "exact": Gives the item which has a value of exactly `value`
    "closest": Gives the item that has value closest to `value`
    "both": Gives a tuple (low, high) of the two items that surround `value`.
    
    For all rounding options, a return value of None is returned if no
    matching item is found. (In the case of rounding="both", either of the
    items in the tuple may be None)
    
    Note: This function uses None to express its inability to find any matches;
    Therefore, you better not use it on sequences in which None is a possible
    item.
